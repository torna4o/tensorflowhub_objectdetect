# Tensorflow and Tensorflow Hub Implementation for Regional Object Detection on an Image

This code heavily uses the tutorial on udacity and its referred tensorflow page for functions. Additionally, a couple of lines and simple writing were added
with lots of comments to guide the user to tweak and modify the code at will.

Link to the tensorflow webpage for several useful functions (already fully coded in the main code of this repository)
https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/object_detection

This will be a living code for further comments and even further addition of functions, models, and data if time permits and/or with the help of you.
